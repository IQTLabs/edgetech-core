# IQT Labs: EdgeTech Project Setup Scripts

The setup scripts contained in this folder are intended to bring a device from a base install of the OS up to a configuration ready for installation of an EdgeTech-compatible tool.

Our installation instructions will usually point from shortened links.  The scripts can be accessed here.


Supported devices currently are:
  - [PinePhone Pro](./pinephone-pro_setup.sh)   |   `curl -fsSL https://short.iqt.org/pinephonepro | sh`
